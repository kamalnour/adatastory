Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs serves as a model for assessing human behavior, offering insights into the profound shifts witnessed during the pandemic. From altered relationship dynamics to revised safety measures and changing professional priorities, our needs underwent a transformative evolution.

The pivotal consideration lies in whether the data collected during this critical period truly encapsulates our emotions and intuitions. Is it aligned with Maslow's enduring theory, a testament to its continued dominance in shaping our daily lives? This study delves into the pandemic-induced changes, exploring whether Maslow's framework remains a relevant and accurate tool for understanding these shifts.

Our research only encompasses EU countries. By examining the intricacies of the data at hand, we aim to uncover the resonance between our evolving needs and the timeless principles outlined by Maslow's Hierarchy, providing a nuanced perspective on the enduring impact of his theory.
The ultimate goal is to redefine this sacred hierarchy in order for it to resonate with the reality that was the life during the pandemic

This behavioral study bases itself on web-browsing data such as Wikipedia page views and Google trends, transportation and mobility data provided by Google and Apple, and EU-centric unemployment data.

# Categorization task
While Mobility and Unemployment Data directly point us to the lower-two levels of the pyramid, Physiological Needs and Safety, exctracting data for the upper three levels is a bit more intricate: Wikipedia pages and topics are not intuitively classified into Esteem, Love and Affection and Self-Actualization, this needed to be done in order to complete the study.
